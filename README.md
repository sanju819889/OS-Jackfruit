## 3. Demo Overview

### Multi-Container Supervision and Metadata Tracking
Two containers (alpha, beta) started and running under one supervisor.
The `ps` command shows ID, PID, STATE, SOFT and HARD memory limits for each running container.

### Bounded-Buffer Logging
Container stdout is captured through the producer-consumer pipeline into log files.
The `cpu_hog` output is captured line by line from the container pipe into the bounded buffer and written to the log file.

### CLI and IPC
CLI commands are issued to the supervisor over the UNIX domain socket.
Container metadata is tracked correctly after lifecycle events such as start, stop, and kill.

### Soft-Limit Warning and Hard-Limit Enforcement
The kernel module detects the `memtest` container RSS exceeding the soft limit (40 MiB) and logs a warning via `dmesg`.
It then kills the container when RSS exceeds the hard limit (64 MiB).
Container metadata is updated to the `killed` state accordingly.

### Scheduling Experiment
`hogA` runs at nice 0 and completes quickly.
`hogB` runs at nice 19 and takes significantly longer due to lower CPU priority under the CFS scheduler.

### Clean Teardown
The supervisor shuts down cleanly with a clean exit message.
No zombie or defunct processes remain after shutdown.
The kernel module unloads cleanly with all entries freed.

## 4. Engineering Analysis

### 1. Isolation Mechanisms
The runtime achieves process isolation using Linux namespaces passed to `clone()`.
`CLONE_NEWPID` creates a new PID namespace so the container process sees itself as PID 1 and cannot see host processes. `CLONE_NEWUTS` allows each container to have its own hostname set via `sethostname()`. `CLONE_NEWNS` isolates the mount namespace so `/proc` can be mounted privately inside the container without affecting the host. `chroot()` then restricts the filesystem view to the assigned rootfs directory, preventing the container from accessing host files.

The host kernel is still shared across all containers. They use the same kernel system call interface, the same network stack (no `CLONE_NEWNET`), and the same CPU scheduler. The kernel mediates all resource access but containers are not fully isolated from each other at the network or IPC level.

### 2. Supervisor and Process Lifecycle
A long-running supervisor is necessary because Linux requires a parent process to call `wait()` on children to prevent zombie processes. Without a persistent parent, child processes become orphans adopted by init, losing the ability to track exit status and update metadata.

The supervisor installs a `SIGCHLD` handler that calls `waitpid(-1, WNOHANG)` in a loop to reap all exited children immediately. `SA_RESTART` ensures system calls interrupted by `SIGCHLD` are automatically restarted. Container metadata is protected by a mutex because both the `SIGCHLD` handler and the main event loop access it concurrently. The `stop_requested` flag distinguishes manual stops from hard-limit kills, allowing accurate state classification in `ps` output.

### 3. IPC, Threads, and Synchronization
Two separate IPC mechanisms are used as required.

**Path A (logging):** Each container's stdout and stderr are connected to the supervisor via a pipe created before `clone()`. The child inherits the write end and the supervisor reads from the read end in a producer thread. Pipes are chosen because they provide natural EOF signalling when the container exits, making cleanup straightforward.

**Path B (control):** CLI clients communicate with the supervisor via a UNIX domain socket at `/tmp/mini_runtime.sock`. UNIX sockets support bidirectional communication and multiple clients, making them suitable for request-response CLI interactions.

The bounded buffer uses a mutex plus two condition variables (`not_full` and `not_empty`). The mutex prevents simultaneous modification of `head`, `tail`, and `count` by multiple producer threads and the consumer thread. Condition variables allow producers to sleep efficiently when the buffer is full and the consumer to sleep when empty, avoiding busy-waiting. The `shutting_down` flag allows clean drain-and-exit behavior in the consumer thread.

### 4. Memory Management and Enforcement
RSS (Resident Set Size) measures the number of pages currently in physical RAM multiplied by page size. It does not include swapped-out pages, memory-mapped files not yet faulted in, or shared library pages.

Soft and hard limits implement different policies. The soft limit triggers a warning logged via `printk`, giving visibility without killing the process. The hard limit enforces a strict ceiling by sending `SIGKILL`.

Enforcement belongs in kernel space because user-space cannot reliably measure or control another process's memory. The kernel has direct access to `mm_struct` and `get_mm_rss()`, and can send `SIGKILL` atomically without the target process being able to intercept or delay it.

### 5. Scheduling Behavior
Linux uses the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). Nice values map to scheduling weights: nice 0 maps to weight 1024 and nice 19 maps to weight 15. When two CPU-bound processes compete, CFS allocates CPU time proportional to weights.

Our experiment ran `hogA` at nice 0 and `hogB` at nice 19 simultaneously. `hogA` completed almost instantly while `hogB` took 22 seconds, demonstrating CFS proportional-share fairness working as designed.

## 5. Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

### Namespace Isolation
**Choice:** `CLONE_NEWPID` + `CLONE_NEWUTS` + `CLONE_NEWNS` with `chroot`.  
**Tradeoff:** `chroot` is simpler than `pivot_root` but allows potential escape via path traversal if the container process has root privileges inside.  
**Justification:** For a project runtime demonstrating isolation concepts, `chroot` provides sufficient isolation with much simpler implementation.

### Supervisor Architecture
**Choice:** Single-threaded event loop with non-blocking `accept()` checking `should_stop` every 10ms, combined with a `SIGCHLD` handler for child reaping.  
**Tradeoff:** Cannot handle concurrent CLI requests simultaneously.  
**Justification:** Container operations are fast and infrequent. Serial handling is correct and simple for a small number of containers.

### IPC and Logging
**Choice:** UNIX domain socket for the control plane, pipes for logging, bounded buffer with mutex and condition variables.  
**Tradeoff:** Pipes are unidirectional so a separate pipe is needed per container.  
**Justification:** Pipe EOF signalling makes producer thread cleanup automatic and correct when containers exit.

### Kernel Monitor
**Choice:** Mutex over spinlock for protecting the monitored process list.  
**Tradeoff:** Mutex cannot be held in hard IRQ context.  
**Justification:** The timer callback runs in softirq context on modern kernels where sleeping is permitted, making mutex the correct and safer choice.

### Scheduling Experiments
**Choice:** Compare two `cpu_hog` containers at nice 0 vs nice 19.  
**Tradeoff:** Results vary with host system load and are not perfectly reproducible.  
**Justification:** Nice values provide a simple, controllable, measurable priority difference that directly demonstrates CFS weighted scheduling.

## 6. Scheduler Experiment Results

| Container | Nice Value | Real Time  | Observation                          |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| hogA      | 0          | 0m0.055s   | Returned quickly, high CPU share     |
| hogB      | 19         | 0m22.278s  | Took 22 seconds, low CPU share       |

Both containers ran `cpu_hog` simultaneously. `hogA` at nice 0 received the majority of available CPU time. `hogB` at nice 19 received significantly less CPU time from the Linux CFS scheduler, taking much longer to complete.

This result matches Linux scheduling theory. CFS assigns weights based on nice values and distributes CPU time proportionally. Under contention, a nice 19 process receives approximately 1/68th the CPU share of a nice 0 process, resulting in dramatically slower throughput for CPU-bound workloads.
